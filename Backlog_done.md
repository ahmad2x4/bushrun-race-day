# Completed Features

## User Experience Improvements

### Pre-Race Staggered Start View ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add pre-race view showing all checked-in runners with their staggered start times
- [x] Sort runners by start time (earliest first)
- [x] Make the staggered start list scrollable
- [x] Highlight runners who need to start at the beginning (0:00 start time)
- [x] Show this view before race starts, then switch to timers after race begins

**Description**: Before race start, users can now see the complete staggered start order with:
1. All checked-in runners sorted by start time
2. Clear indication of who starts at 0:00 (beginning starters shown first)
3. Scrollable list to handle many runners
4. Automatic transition to timer view when race starts

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**User Impact**: Critical for race organization

**Implementation Details**:
- Enhanced `StaggeredStartQueue` component with `showPreRace` prop
- Reused existing UI/cards for consistency
- Modified timer display to show "Starts at XX:XX" in pre-race mode
- Integrated into `RaceDirectorView` to replace basic ready state
- Seamless transition from pre-race overview to live timing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/race/StaggeredStartQueue.tsx`
- `src/components/views/RaceDirectorView.tsx`
