### Cross-Distance Handicap Calculations ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement cross-distance handicap calculations for unofficial entries
- [x] Add conversion functions implementing 5/6 ratio and 2.1 conversion factor
- [x] Round results to nearest 15 seconds (MROUND equivalent)
- [x] Handle blank/missing handicaps gracefully
- [x] Update UI to indicate calculated/unofficial handicap status
- [x] Provide clear messaging to runners about unofficial status

**Description**: Allow runners who have a handicap for one distance (5k or 10k) but not the other to participate in the other distance with a calculated handicap. The calculated time is marked as unofficial and the runner is informed that this is a calculated estimate.

**Use Cases Implemented**:
1. Runner has 5k handicap but wants to do 10k on race day
2. Runner has 10k handicap but wants to do 5k on race day

**Implementation Details**:

**Core Functions in raceLogic.ts**:
- `roundToNearest15Seconds()` - Excel MROUND equivalent for 15-second rounding
- `convert10kTo5k()` - Converts 10k handicaps to 5k using Excel formula: `5/6*1/24-(1/24-handicap_value)/2.1`
- `convert5kTo10k()` - Converts 5k handicaps to 10k using Excel formula: `1/24-(5/6*1/24-handicap_value)*2.1`
- `getHandicapForDistance()` - Returns official or calculated handicap with `isCalculated` flag

**UI Integration in CheckinView**:
- Seamlessly displays calculated handicaps when official handicap unavailable
- Shows informational notification when handicap is calculated (unofficial)
- Simple notification approach without complex approval workflows

**Formula Behavior**:
- 10k to 5k conversions work for all typical 10k handicap values
- 5k to 10k conversions only work for large 5k handicaps (>21:30) due to formula mathematics
- For typical fast 5k handicaps (2-10 min), conversion returns 00:00 (formula produces negative result)
- This behavior is expected and documented in comprehensive test suite

**Technical Features**:
- Uses 15-second rounding for cross-distance calculations (vs 5-second for regular handicaps)
- Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs
- Maintains existing functionality while adding cross-distance support
- Format consistency between '00:00' and '0:00' styles

**Testing**: 18+ comprehensive unit tests covering all conversion scenarios and edge cases

**Priority**: Medium (enhances race day flexibility)
**Effort**: Medium
**User Impact**: High - enables participation in distances without official handicaps
**Completed**: 2025-09-28

**Files Modified**:
- `src/raceLogic.ts` - Core conversion functions and handicap logic
- `src/raceLogic.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `src/components/views/CheckinView.tsx` - UI integration with notification system

- [x] Add "+" button on check-in view for registering new members on race day
- [x] Implement temporary member number assignment (starting from 999, decreasing)
- [x] Add distance selection (5km/10km) during registration
- [x] Auto-check-in new members after registration
- [x] Display assigned temp number prominently to new member
- [x] Include temporary members in runner lists and CSV exports
- [x] Create comprehensive E2E test suite
- [x] Add Storybook documentation

**Description**: Allows race directors to quickly register new members on race day who are trying the club for the first time. These new members receive temporary member numbers (999, 998, 997...) and are immediately checked in to participate in the race.

**User Story**:
"As a race director, when someone shows up on race day who isn't a member yet, I need to quickly register them with a temporary number so they can participate. They need to know their temp number to tell the timekeeper at the finish line."

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Data Structure Changes**:
   - Added `next_temp_number: number` to Race interface (starts at 999, decrements)
   - Temporary members identified by: `member_number >= 900` AND provisional status
   - Migration added for existing races to initialize field

2. **UI Components**:
   - Compact "+" button on number pad (green, accessible with aria-label)
   - NewMemberDialog with two screens:
     - Registration form (name input + distance selection)
     - Success screen showing large temp number
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design with dark mode support

3. **User Flow**:
   - Click "+" button → Opens registration dialog
   - Enter name → Select distance (5km/10km) → Click Register
   - Success screen shows assigned number (999, 998, etc.)
   - Click "Done" → Dialog closes, member is checked in

4. **New Member Defaults**:
   - `member_number`: Next temp number (999, 998, 997...)
   - `checked_in: true` (auto check-in)
   - `current_handicap_5k/10k: '00:00'` (no start delay)
   - `is_official_5k/10k: false` (provisional status)
   - `is_financial_member: false`

5. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed dialog closing issue by removing premature state reset
   - Simplified handleClose to only call onClose() and let useEffect handle cleanup

**Files Created**:
- `src/components/forms/NewMemberDialog.tsx` - Main registration dialog component
- `src/components/forms/NewMemberDialog.stories.tsx` - Storybook documentation
- `tests/new-member-registration.spec.ts` - Comprehensive E2E test suite (9 test scenarios)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/types.ts` - Added next_temp_number to Race interface
- `src/components/ui/NumberPad.tsx` - Added compact "+" button with flex layout
- `src/components/views/CheckinView.tsx` - Integrated registration flow
- `src/components/views/SetupView.tsx` - Initialize next_temp_number for new races
- `src/App.tsx` - Migration for existing races

**Testing**:
- 9 comprehensive E2E test scenarios covering:
  - Registration for both 5km and 10km
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Cancel/close dialog functionality
  - Decrementing temp number sequence
  - Form state management
  - Dark mode compatibility
  - Mobile accessibility (touch targets)
  - State reset between registrations

**Priority**: Medium (Nice-to-have for race day operations)
**Effort**: Medium (new dialog component + check-in integration + E2E tests)
**User Impact**: Medium (helps with occasional new runner registrations)
**Completed**: 2025-12-07

### Championship System Phase 1 - CSV Integration & Core Calculation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement championship data structure with race history tracking
- [x] Implement BBR official points calculation engine
- [x] Update CSV parsing to handle championship fields
- [x] Update CSV export functions for championship data
- [x] Integrate championship updates into race calculation workflow
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with 72+ championship-specific tests

**Description**: Phase 1 of the Championship System implementation adds comprehensive championship tracking to the Bushrun Race Day application. Runners' race participation and points are now tracked across the season (February-November) with automatic best-8 race selection.

**Key Features**:
- **Race History Format**: `MONTH:POSITION:POINTS:TIME` pipe-delimited (e.g., "2:1:20:895|3:2:15:920")
- **Points System**: BBR official scoring (1st=20, 2nd=15, 3rd=11, 4th=8, 5th=6, 6th=5, 7th=4, 8th=3, 9th=2, 10th+=1)
- **Special Cases**: Starter/Timekeeper=4pts, Early Start=1pt, DNF=1pt
- **Best 8 Logic**: Unlimited participation, only best 8 races count toward championship
- **Official Eligibility**: Only runners with `is_official_5k`/`is_official_10k=true` earn points
- **Race Months**: 2-11 (February through November)
- **Backward Compatible**: All new fields optional; existing CSVs work unchanged

**Implementation Details**:

**Type System (src/types.ts)**:
- Added `RaceHistoryEntry` interface for structured race data
- Extended `Runner` interface with 4 championship fields:
  - `championship_races_5k/10k`: Serialized race history
  - `championship_points_5k/10k`: Best 8 totals

**Championship Functions (src/raceLogic.ts)**:
- `getChampionshipPoints()`: Position→Points conversion
- `parseChampionshipRaceHistory()`: Deserialize race history with validation
- `formatChampionshipRaceHistory()`: Serialize race data to string
- `calculateBest8Total()`: Sum best 8 races
- `appendRaceToHistory()`: Add/update race result
- `updateChampionshipData()`: Integrate after race completion

**CSV Integration**:
- `parseCSV()`: Parse championship fields from uploaded CSVs
- `generateNextRaceCSV()`: Export championship data for next season
- `generateResultsCSV()`: Export race results with points earned
- Graceful degradation for CSVs without championship fields

**Test Coverage**:
- 72+ championship-specific test cases
- Edge cases: special positions, 9th race, empty histories
- Integration tests with full race flow
- CSV parsing/export validation
- 100% test pass rate (165/165 tests)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/types.ts` - New `RaceHistoryEntry` interface, Runner championship fields
- `src/raceLogic.ts` - 6 championship functions, CSV integration, calculateHandicaps enhancement
- `src/raceLogic.test.ts` - 72+ championship test cases

**Quality Metrics**:
- ✅ 165/165 tests passing
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Successful production build

**Priority**: High (Core championship functionality)
**Effort**: Medium (200+ lines of logic, comprehensive testing)
**User Impact**: High (enables season-long championship tracking)
**Completed**: 2025-12-25
**Commit**: `5bc7d53`

**Future Phases** (Deferred):
- Phase 2: Championship UI & Results Integration
