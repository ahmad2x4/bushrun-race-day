## User Experience Improvements


### Time Adjustment Enhancement
- [ ] Add tap-and-hold functionality to +/- buttons for faster time adjustment
- [ ] Implement accelerated time changes (5 second increments) when holding buttons after initial delay

**Description**: Currently users need to tap multiple times to adjust start times significantly. Add tap-and-hold with acceleration:
1. Initial tap: +/- 1 second
2. Hold with delay: Switch to +/- 5 seconds every interval
3. Continue until user releases

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Small
**User Impact**: High for users with large time adjustments
