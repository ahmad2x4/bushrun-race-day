# Bushrun Race Day - Development Backlog

## Sprint Status
- ✅ **Sprint 1**: Project Foundation & Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Sprint 2**: Data Layer & CSV Processing - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Sprint 3**: Check-in System - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Sprint 4**: Race Director Interface - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Sprint 5**: Results & Handicap Calculations - COMPLETED
- 🟡 **Sprint 6**: PWA & Polish - PENDING

## Current Priority Fixes (Before Sprint 3)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Fix handicap system understanding
- **Issue**: UI descriptions incorrectly suggest handicap = head start time
- **Reality**: Handicap = start delay time (lower handicap = earlier start)
- **Impact**: Affects race timing logic and user understanding
- **Files to update**: `src/App.tsx`, `sample-data/README.md`, UI text

### 🔧 Add 'Reset Race' button to Setup view
- **Issue**: Cannot reset/clear race after CSV upload to test new files
- **Need**: Button in race configuration view to clear race and return to upload
- **Include**: Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resets

### 📝 Update race timer to handle staggered starts
- **Logic**: Lower handicap (2:00) starts before higher handicap (10:00)
- **Implementation**: Timer needs to track individual runner start times
- **Display**: Show both elapsed time and individual runner times

### 🎨 Fix UI descriptions to clarify handicap system
- **Update**: Change "head start" references to "start delay"
- **Add**: Tooltips explaining handicap timing
- **Clarify**: CSV upload instructions

### 📚 Update documentation and comments
- **Files**: `src/raceLogic.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `sample-data/README.md`
- **Focus**: Correct handicap system explanations
- **Tests**: Ensure unit tests reflect correct understanding
